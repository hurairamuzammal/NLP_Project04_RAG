It is not affected by BCG vaccination, so it is especially suitable in areas where BCG has been vaccinated.    \nTuberculin test (TST): Inject a certain amount of purified protein derivative (PPD) into the skin and observe the reaction of the skin 48 to 72 hours later to determine whether the patient is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Results need to be judged based on the size of the induration, usually 5 mm or larger is considered a positive reaction, but this also depends on the individual's specific circumstances such as HIV infection or recent exposure to a case of tuberculosis.\n"

Although simple and low-cost, it is less sensitive. \nSputum culture: This is the gold standard for diagnosing tuberculosis. The sputum sample is cultured in a specific medium to see if Mycobacterium tuberculosis is growing. Culture can provide information about resistance but takes a long time (usually weeks to months). \nMolecular biology detection methods: such as PCR technology, which can quickly detect the genetic material of Mycobacterium tuberculosis with high sensitivity and specificity, and is especially suitable for patients with negative sputum smear. \nChest X-ray: Chest X-ray is a commonly used screening tool for patients suspected of having active pulmonary tuberculosis, which can reveal abnormalities in the lungs, such as patchy shadows, cavities, etc.\n"

No urgent endoscopy was recommended. Of note, review of our records was significant for several ED visits in which she presented for pain.
