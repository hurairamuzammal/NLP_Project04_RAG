There is severe hypokinesis of the remaining segments, with worse hypokinesis in the mid-level compared with the basal walls (LVEF = 15 %). The estimated cardiac index is normal (>=2.5L/min/m2). No masses or thrombi are seen in the left ventricle. Diastolic function could not be assessed. Right ventricular chamber size is normal with borderline normal free wall function. The aortic valve leaflets (?#) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global dysfunction c/w CAD (3VD). Borderline right ventricular systolic function.IMPRESSION: Dilated left ventricle with severe regional and global dysfunction c/w CAD (3VD). Borderline right ventricular systolic function.\n\n___ CARDIAC CATHETERIZATION\nMultiple attempts were required for right radial arterial access. The Magic Torque wire could not be delivered into the proximalright subclavian artery past the right vertebral artery due toextreme tortuousity (most likely a 360 degree turn). Rightfemoral artery access was then obtained using ultrasound imagingguidance and a MicroPuncture kit on the attempt. The RIMA waspatent.\n\nThe heart appeared dilated with splayed coronary arteries widely separated. There was dense posterior mitral annular calcification.\n\nCoronary angiography: CO-dominant\n  LMCA: The LMCA was short with distal funneling to 25%.\n  LAD: The proximal LAD was heavily calcified. The mid LAD was occluded after small D1, D2 and D3 branches. There was faint reconstitution of the mid-distal LAD via left-to-left collaterals.\n  LCX: The AV groove CX was large in caliber with mild plaquing throughout. There were 2 short OM1 and OM2 branches with no obvious perfusion of the high lateral wall (raising the possibility of an occluded ramus intermedius branch). The major OM3/LPL1 had an origin tubular 70% stenosis. LPL2 was subtotally occluded proximally and reconstituted via left-to-left collaterals with distal moderate disease at a bifurcation and TIM1 flow. The distal CX supplied collaterals to the diseased RPDA and RCA with retrograde filling up to the mid RCA. The LPDA was somewhat tortuous.\n  RCA: The RCA was occluded proximally past the conus and SA nodal branches. There was no reconstitution of the native RCA beyond.\n\n___ CXR \nThere is mild-to-moderate cardiomegaly with left ventricular configuration. The aorta is unfolded.  There is possible minimal upper zone re-distribution, but no other evidence of CHF.  No focal infiltrate or effusion.  No pneumothorax detected. Increased opacity adjacent to the left cardiac apex/left costophrenic angle most likely is related to a cardiac fat pad and/or overlying soft tissues. \n  \nIMPRESSION:  Cardiomegaly.

A dual-chamber cardiac pacer is present.  There is moderate \ncardiomegaly, and an unfolded, slightly tortuous aorta.  There are coarse increased interstitial markings throughout both lung bases, consistent with mild interstitial edema. There is no overt pulmonary edema. lines are noted and could reflect chronic CHF.

The AV groove RCA just after the RPDA had an 85% stenosis (distal stent edge restenosis) with TIMI 2 pulsatile flow. The RPL1 just beyond this 85% stenosis had an origin 50% stenosis. RPL2 was of modest caliber and diffusely diseased. RPL3 had a laterally oriented sidebranch. The RCA ran well up the lateral aspect of the AV\ngroove."

According to her son she was not short of breath prior to this event and has been walking distances of several miles, including stairs. No orthopnea or edema in her lower extremities. She did not have any chest pain prior to or during this event and denies any angina in the past six months. She denies recent illness. \n﻿\nthe patient was short of breath but without chest pain. Initial CXR indicated pulmonary edema and a BNP was elevated to 341. EKG was significant for old inferior wall infarct. Initial troponin was elevated to .53, which trended down to .38. She was given 40 of IV Lasix at which time her symptoms improved significantly. She was transferred for possible cardiac cath. Upon transfer she was no longer short of breath and had no signs of fluid overload on exam. \n﻿\nthe patient is not short of breath and denies chest pain.

She was taken to the cath lab with catheterization results showing subtotal occluded OM s/p DES as well as 95% RCA that was not intervened upon given contrast load. Initially, they attempted radial access but that was unsuccessful given small radial artery. Also, patient developed radial hematoma. She had groin access. She was treated with bivalirusin drip during the case and 30 minutes afterwards. She was loaded with Plavix. She was also started on ICF for hydration. \n﻿\nOn the floor, patient was tired but chest pain free. She was surrounded by family and they confirmed the history detailed above.",

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests an increased left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP>18mmHg). The aortic valve leaflets are mildly thickened (?#). There is mild aortic valve stenosis (valve area 1.2-1.9cm2). Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Mild to moderate mitral regurgitation is seen. [Due to acoustic shadowing, the severity of mitral regurgitation may be significantly UNDERestimated.] There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n﻿\nIMPRESSION: Suboptimal image quality. Moderate aortic stenosis. Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with preserved regional and global biventricular systolic function. Mild-moderate mitral regurgitation. Mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

He says his discomfort has been going on for a few weeks, and he has been attributing it to a musculoskeletal injury from working out. The pain subsided after working out at the gym, and he subsequently went to work. At some point later in the morning at work, he developed sudden onset dizziness, sweating, and chest pain that he described as \"knifelike\". He became so uncomfortable that he \"could not speak\". His wife, who works in the same office as him, called ___. He also had one episode of vomiting.\n\nHe was brought to cath lab where he had total occlusion of LAD. 3 DES (2.5mmx15mm, 3mmx15mm, 3.5mmx15mm) placed in LAD. There was no reflow which minimally responded to intracoronary agents. Given ongoing angina and poor flow in LAD, he was started on an IABP in addition to IV eptifibitide and IV heparin. Given 180 mcg of 325 mg, and 4000U heparin. Subsequently transferred here for further workup and management.\n\nVitals prior to transfer 138/77 w O2 sats 99% on 4L NC.\n\nOn arrival to the CCU, patient was having persistent chest pain and nausea. He was started on a nitro drip with little relief. His EKG showed worsening ST elevations, and the decision was made to bring him to the cath lab. In our Cath Lab his balloon pump was removed and replaced with an Impella via the right groin. His LVEDP went from ___ after balloon placement. Per verbal sign out from the Cath Lab, the stents placed earlier in the day appeared patent but there was residual disease distal to them. Ultimately 2 additional stents were placed in the LAD. Angiography of the LAD revealed TIMI III flow, 0% residual, occluded diagnoal branch likely due to pre-existing dissection, but no dissection in the LAD proper. \n\nHe also had another stent placed in his OM1 which was 95% occluded. Final angiography of the OM revealed TIMI III flow, 0% residual, and no dissection. He received about 1 L of IV fluid in the Cath Lab, as well as 210 cc of contrast.\n\nUpon return to the CCU, his Impella was noted to be properly placed on bedside ultrasound, and his chest pain had improved.\n\nLABS NOTABLE FOR: WBC 10.9 HGB 15.4 PLT GLC 126\n\nROS: Positive per HPI.

He has been a lifelong heavy drinker and smoker, but he's been drinking far more than usual and at atypical times of day. He's also had erratic behavior including spending all his time naked, being incontinent of urine and sometimes stool, shouting sporadically and playing loud music, and other behavior that is very atypical for him. He was recently hospitalized for a rectal foreign body that was removed successfully. Due to concern for behavioral changes and rapidly progressive dementia, neurology was consulted. They suggested an extensive neurologic workup but the patient left AMA. He has since established with neurology but has also declined a workup there. \n\nHe was having a typical day, and drinking heavily during the day. His wife made him a sandwich and left the room briefly and returned when she heard gurgling sounds. She found him to have jerking movements of his extremities and not responding to her. She called EMS who arrived within minutes and found him to be pulseless VF and delivered a shock, regaining a pulse. He was intubated in the field. He received an amiodarone bolus. He was given 600mg aspirin PR. \n\nOn arrival, there is observed to be anterior ST elevations. Angiography showed 95% LM ostial stenosis, 90% LAD extending to mid-LAD and 90% stenosis at large diagonal. the circumflex has 80% mid stenosis. The RCA had minimal disease.

LINE PLACEM\nIMPRESSION:  \nIn comparison to radiograph, a right internal jugular central venous catheter is been placed, terminating in the lower superior vena cava, with no visible pneumothorax.  Slight widening of the mediastinum is likely due to accentation of a tortuous thoracic aorta by patient rotation and supine portable technique, but a repeat nonrotated radiograph would be helpful to confirm this impression when the patient's condition permits.  Lungs are clear except for minor atelectasis at the left lung base. \n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nIMPRESSION: \nAs compared to previous study of 1 day earlier, there has not been a substantial change in the appearance of the chest except for slight \nimprovement in minor left basilar atelectasis. \n\nFEMORAL VASCULAR US RIG\nIMPRESSION: \n1. No evidence of pseudoaneurysm or AV fistula and the right groin. \n2. Organized hematoma in the right groin measuring up to 7 cm. \n3. No drainable fluid collection. \n  \nCT ABD & PELVIS W/O CON\nIMPRESSION:  \n1.   Infrarenal fusiform abdominal aortic aneurysm measuring up to is 4.7 cm in maximum diameter without evidence of aneurysmal leak, impending or contained rupture.  Recommend follow-up CT at 6 month interval. \n2.   Status post LHC complicated by a right arterial groin bleed.  6.7 x 2.3 cm area of increased density in the anteromedial aspect of right thigh with extensive soft tissue stranding and edema, most consistent with a soft tissue hematoma.  No evidence of retroperitoneal hematoma. \n3.  Cholelithiasis without cholecystitis. \n4.  Focal consolidation of the apex of the left upper lobe, likely related to scarring from chronic parenchymal disease. \n\nCHEST (PORTABLE AP) \nFINDINGS:  \nCardiomegaly is a stable.  The patient is rotated, this accentuates the widened mediastinum and tortuous aorta.  Improving left lower lobe atelectasis, otherwise the lungs are clear.  There is no pneumothorax or pleural effusion.  Right IJ catheter tip is in the lower SVC"

There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with dyskinesis of the basal to mid inferior and inferolateral segments and hypokinesis of the basal to mid lateral segments and inferior apex . [Intrinsic left ventricular systolic function is likely more depressed given the severity of valvular regurgitation.] Quantitative (biplane) LVEF = 47 %. There is no ventricular septal defect. The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with mild global free wall hypokinesis. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion.

Moderate mitral regurgitation.  \n﻿\nCath:\nCOMMENTS: 1. Selective coronary angiography of this right dominant system demonstrated three vessel coronary artery disease. The LMCA had a 20% ostial and distal stenosis. The LAD had a mid vessel 80% ulcerated plaque. The Ramus had a mid 70% stenosis. The RCA has total ostial occulsion with robust left to right collaterals. The LCx had mild luminal irregularities. \n2. Resting hemodynamic measurement demonstrated normal systemic arterial pressure at 112/72 mm Hg. Pullback of the pigtail catheter from the LV to the aorta did not demonstrate a gradient. The left sided filling pressure was elevated with an LVEDP of 25 mmHg. \n3. Successful ptca and stenting of the mid LAD with a 3.5x18 mm cypher stent. Successful ptca and stenting of the mid Ramus with a 2.5x8mm cypher stent. Successful ptca and stenting of the proximal rca with a 3.5x33mm cypher stent. Final angiography revealed 0% residual stenosis, no angiographically apparet dissection and timi 3 flow. The patient left the lab free of angina and in stable condition."

Labs were notable for a troponin T of 0.14, normal CBC, initial EKG with nonspecific ST changes. She was given sublingual nitro with help with her chest discomfort, as well as full dose aspirin and ticagrelor 180. Subsequent EKG showed ST elevations \n﻿\nHer chest pain had improved. Per verbal sign out, in the Cath Lab, she initially underwent right radial approach and had findings consistent with RCA with a subtotal occlusion that appeared chronic and calcified with sluggish flow distally. Her left-sided circulation showed a 60% stenosis of her obtuse marginal, and an LAD with no significant disease but moderate calcifications. Her access had to be switched to right groin because of a short and tortuous aorta. The operator was unable to wire the RCA lesion successfully because of likely chronic nature and calcifications. Given that she was chest pain-free and her EKG had improved, no further intervention was pursued. She was brought to the CCU with a plan to potentially return to the Cath Lab later this morning for CTO procedure.\n﻿\nOn arrival to the CCU, She is comfortable, cheerful, and chest pain-free.

She exercised for 6.5 minutes of protocol METs) and stopped due to fatigue. This represents a fair functional capacity for her age. She complained of mild mid-sternal to left shoulder pressure at peak exercise, which resolved almost completely by 5 minutes of recovery with the remaining discomfort only occuring with palpation. In the presence of RBBB on baseline ECG, there were no changes in ST segment or T wave morphology noted during exercise or in recovery. The rhythm was sinus with one isolated PVC seen during exercise and one ventricular couplet seen in immediate recovery. The heart rate and blood pressure responses were mildly blunted (beta blockade). \n  \n___ CXR:\nNo acute cardiopulmonary abnormality. \n  \n___ ECHO bedside:\nThe left atrium is normal in size. Left ventricular wall thicknesses and cavity size are normal. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded - it appears that the inferior wall may be hypokinetic. Overall left ventricular systolic function is low normal (LVEF 50-55%). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with focal hypokinesis of the apical free wall. There is abnormal septal motion/position. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The aortic valve leaflets (3) appear structurally normal with good leaflet excursion and no aortic stenosis or aortic regurgitation. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is no pericardial effusion. If clinically indicated, a complete transthoracic examination with Doppler is recommended. \n\nCompared with the prior study (images reviewed), right ventricle is slightly larger. Regional left ventricular function cannot be reliably assessed on this emergency study.\n\nECG:\nnon-ST-elevation"

The patient exercised for 5 minutes of a Modified protocol and was stopped for fatigue. The estimated peak MET capacity was 3.8, which represents a poor exercise tolerance for her age. There were no reports of chest, back, neck, or arm discomforts during the study. Dyspnea was noted throughout exercise which improved during recovery. There were no significant ST segment changes noted during exercise or early recovery. After 3 minutes of recovery, the facility lost power and EKGs were not acquired for the remainder of the study. Rhythm was sinus with occasional isolated VPBs and rare isolated APBs. The heart rate response was appropriate during exercise and recovery.

This level of exercise represents a poor exercise tolerance for age. In response to stress, the ECG showed no diagnostic ST-T wave changes (see exercise report for details). There is resting hypertension. There were normal blood pressure and heart rate responses to stress. \nResting images were acquired at a heart rate of 74 bpm and a blood pressure of 150/90 mmHg.

These demonstrated new regional dysfunction with severe hypokinesis of the mid- and distal segments of the anterior wall, septum as the apex (mid-LAD territory). The remaining segments augment appropriately. There was augmentation of right ventricular free wall motion. \n﻿\nIMPRESSION: Poor functional exercise capacity.

Apparently, his chest symptoms resolved after having been given additional aspirin in about one hour. He has no recall having  been given nitroglycerin. In the ED, ECG was reported as normal  and troponin slightly elevated to 0.133 (top normal at 0.045).  \nD-dimer was negative. Renal function was normal. Because of the elevated troponin, he was advised to have immediate cardiac catheterization, but signed out against advice and came to see \nDr. at his regularly scheduled appointment.\n \nIn the ED, initial vitals were 76 128/65 16 100% RA.

Patient rotation limits evaluation of the cardiomediastinal contour, but there is cardiomegaly and mild pulmonary edema. No site of focal consolidation is seen to suggest pneumonia and there is no pleural effusion.  \n\nHEAD CT WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: There is no hemorrhage, edema, mass effect, shift of midline structures, or evidence of major vascular territory infarction. The ventricles and sulci are prominent and are enlarged in size, consistent with age-related parenchymal involutional change. In addition, there is asymmetric enlargement of the extra-axial CSF space on the left. This may represent a combination of asymmetric parenchymal atrophy and possible chronic subdural hematoma or hygroma, although this differentiation is difficult with lack of remote prior studies.

The right atrium is moderately dilated. There is asymmetric left ventricular hypertrophy. The left ventricular cavity size is normal. There is mild regional left ventricular systolic dysfunction with apical hypokinesis. The remaining segments contract normally (LVEF = 50%). There is no left ventricular outflow obstruction at rest or with Valsalva. These findings are consistent with hypertrophic non-obstructive cardiomyopathy (HCM). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The aortic root is mildly dilated at the sinus level. The ascending aorta is moderately dilated. The aortic valve leaflets are moderately thickened. There is no aortic valve stenosis. Trace aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are structurally normal. There is no systolic anterior motion of the mitral valve leaflets. Mild (1+) mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal.

Given the more frequent palpitations, the association of weakness with her palpitations, and this episode of chest pain, she presented to her PCP's office for evaluation.\n\nIn the PCP's office, she was noted to be in Afib.

The patient was infused 0.142 mg/kg/min of dipyridamole over 4 mins. No arm, chest, neck or back discomfort noted during the study. There were no ST segment changes during the infusion or during recovery. The rhythm was sinus with two runs of PSVT (one 3 beat during infusion and the second ___ beat run in recovery), two PACs and single atrial couplet. Appropriate hemodynamic response to infusion and recovery. The dipyridamole was reversed with 125 mg IV aminophylline.\n\nTTE ___:\nThe left atrium is mildly dilated. There is mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with normal cavity size. Due to suboptimal technical quality, a focal wall motion abnormality cannot be fully excluded. Left ventricular systolic function is hyperdynamic (EF>75%). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. The diameters of aorta at the sinus, ascending and arch levels are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve leaflets are not well visualized. The transaortic gradient is higher than expected for this type of prosthesis. No aortic regurgitation is seen. There is mild pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \n\nIMPRESSION: Mild symmetric left ventricular hypertrophy with hyperdynamic systolic function. Well seated aortic valve bioprosthesisleft with increased transaortic gradients, likely secondary to incrased flow from high output versus patient/prosthesis mismatch (similar mean gradient reported on post-op TEE. True prosthesis stenosis is less likely given the early peaking contour of the transaortic jet velocity (AT < 100 ms), although cannot completely exclude."

The patient was challeneged with 500cc of IVF bolused via the right \natrium. With this the LVEDP increased to 22mmHg and RVEDP to 18mmHg. Right atrial pressure increased to ___ (a/v/mean). \n4. After fluid bolus simultaneous LV and RV pressure tracings demonstrated concordance over the respiratory cycle and with valsalva. There was a dip and plateau morphology to LV filling. These findings are consistent with restrictive physiology."

She describes the sensation as 'pins and needles' similar to her foot falling asleep, but had not woken up in an unusual position or rested her leg on any hard surface overnight. Her paresthesiae did not resolve over the next few minutes, prompting her to activate EMS. There, she underwent a non-contrast head CT that was noted to have a few new linear areas of hyperdensity in the area of a prior parietal infarct; as a subdural hematoma could not beexcluded per report, she was transferred for Neurosurgical evaluation. Notably, her symptoms resolved while obtaining her imaging, lasting approximately two hours in total.

This morning, the patient was in a continuing education seminar at which time, she was witnessed to have two of the asymmetric posturing and non-rhythmic tremor events for which EMS was activated.  Per the run report of the patient to ED, she had two further events with very little post-ictal confusion or fatigue, rather only some quieter speech.  She had another event while in transport, for which she received 1mg ativan with good effect.  While in the ED she also had two events which were treated with 1mg ativan, and then 2mg ativan, roughly apart of each other.\n\nIn the ED with Neurology present, the patient had two further episodes of seizure which were not treated with any intervention. The semiology of these included the patient closing her eyes and becoming unresponsive, then her eyes became tightly closed with subsequent back arching and asymmetric tonic posturing of her upper and lower extremities. The patient subsequently began having nonrhythmic convulsive activity and was able to have alternating upper and lower extremity movement with a turn from her right to her left lateral decubitus.  This event lasted for approximately 90 seconds with resolution. No postictal confusion or frank fatigue as noted, nor was any paralysis experienced.  During his advanced the patient was able to pull off her EKG leads.\n\nRecently, she was admitted for characterization of these events on video EEG monitoring.

He was being treated at this facility for poly substance abuse including heroin, benzos and opiates on Methadone 100 mg day. Per OSH documentation, benzos Xanax per day) were quickly weaned off at facility and may have prompted these events. At OSH pt was noted to have an episodes of tonic clonic movement and convulsions with urinary incontinence. He was managed in ICU out of concern for benzo withdrawal and was treated with high dose benzos. He was reportedly evaluated by neurology and thought that may be pseudo seizures (pt himself feels that these are pseudoseizures) started on Keppra 500 mg BID with no effect. He continued to have episodes per day. Routine EEG was performed but there was no neurologist to read due to neurologist there being on vacation until end. He was then transferred as a direct admission for further evaluation. \n\nOf note, en route he had an episode where he suddenly stopped talking to EMS and his whole body began to shake violently. EMS brought him to the ED where he continued to violently shake all his extremities non rhythmically. He was given 2mg Ativan x1 without improvement. ED resident put saline in his eyes which stopped the episode immediately. Entire episode lasted circa 15 minutes per report w/ postictal drowsiness.\n\nPer OSH documentation, pt has hx of \"partial complex seizure disorder\" for which he had previously been taking Lamictal and Lyrica, now on Tegretol. However, \n\nHet states that he first developed these type of events when he was 11 years old (at that time with aura of electrical activity moving up his body), at that time being started on Phenobarbital by his family doctor. He continued on this medication until he was 16 years old when his doctor left town and he could no longer obtain. He states that his seizures returned but evolved into more myoclonic activity (imitates in bed as a whole body jerk). Around this time he began to buy benzodiazepines  on the street as preventative therapy, particularly when he felt that a seizure may be coming on. He thinks that he used this medication 1/month w/ control of his episodes. At the same time he also began to engage in heroin use. This behavior continued for some years until college when he began to have breakthrough events. Soon after that he was working in where  he was able to obtain Phenobarbital with cessation of his episodes. However, they returned when he came back to US and was unable to receive medication. He had a similar experience while working in the following year. In the last years he quit heroin but began to take Valium daily. Because he continued to be dependent on this medication, he presented to detox when he had seizure like activity and was sent.",

She would awaken from sleep with sensation of nausea, diaphoresis, and generally feeling ill. The symptoms were often accompanied by episodes of vomiting, initially undigested food followed by bilious vomit. There was no blood.

Per most recent note of Dr H \"testing for ulcer disease, H pylori, pyloric stenosis, celiac sprue, and gallbladder disease has been negative.

We would recommend obtaining a morning cortisol and ACTH level, ___, SPEP, UPEP and an MRI of the head given her headaches and nocturnal episodes of vomiting. We will  plan to obtain a gastric emptying study to look for evidence of  gastroparesis and an upper GI series to look at the extent of  gastroesophageal reflux.\"  \n\nShe presented this evening to the ED because her symptoms were worsening, and she has not been able to hold down any substantial amount of food for the last two weeks.

The patient also underwent esophageal function testing including a pH impedance and manometry.  His manometry showed that swallows were peristaltic with remaining five associated with either drops or ineffective peristalsis.  The mean amplitude of contraction was 48.

She reports that it has been constant with some waking and waning since 1700. She reports that the pain is worse when she vomits.  Given the chest pain she presented to the ED for evaluation. She reports in the ED the nausea worsened and she vomited. She reports that she has the burning in her chest and needs to drink 1L of fluid so that she can then throw up. SHe reports that the water can not be cold as that would cause spasms of her throat and be uncomfortable. \n\nIn the ED she was evaluated. Her EKG was unremarkable. Her first set of troponins were negative. She developed hypoxia (unclear to what level) in the setting of her nausea and vomiting. SHe had a CXR that was unremarkable. She had a CTA of the chest and CT abd/pelvis. The CT scan showed bilateral ground glass that could be consistent with infection vs inflammation. She was given levofloxacin and admitted to the medical service. \n\nOn the medical floor the patient was sating well on room air, was non-toxic appearing, requested oral fluids and \"mashed potato, bacon bagel, and egg salad\". She reports that she had not had a cough over the last several weeks, had no fevers. She reports that she has the pain in her chest and the nausea and nothing else. \n\nROS: A ten point ROS was conducted and was negative except as above in the HPI.",

He finally lay down to sleep that night and when he awoke in the morning the pain had dissipated completely. The pressure and pain returned yesterday while patient was sitting and doing work on his Ipad. He then got up and walked on a treadmill - to his surprise, the pain soon subsided. He has not taken any SL nitro at home. Given his recurrent symptoms, patient called his cardiologist who referred him to the ED. Patient denies any associated shortness of breath, palpitations, or cough. No new lower extremity swelling. No fevers/chills. No recent NVCD. He has felt somewhat more lethargic. Of note, patient had a recent MIBI to evaluate similar complaints of chest discomfort at the time. The MIBI showed a reversible ischemia in the LAD territory and he was started on metoprolol.  \nIn the ED:  \nInitial vitals were: 97.8 63 130/70 19 100% RA \nPatient complained of mild chest pressure, however, after 3 hours his chest pain resolved.",

He attempted some of his wife's supplemental oxygen with improvement in shortness of breath. He tried 80mg PO of lasix (20mg above his usual dose of 60mg daily) to no avail. He endorses a progressively worsening dry cough, but denies any edema, weight gain, fevers/chills, or chest pain/pressure.",

Extensive retrocardiac opacity is noted, likely atelectasis, although an early developing pneumonia cannot be excluded. There is blunting of the left costophrenic angle and to a lesser severity on the right as well, possibly due to small effusions. No gross consolidation is seen. There is no definite superimposed edema. Again noted is a tortuous atherosclerotic aorta. The cardiac silhouette is markedly enlarged but stable. No displaced fractures are evident. IMPRESSION: Retrocardiac opacity likely atelectasis, although pneumonia cannot be entirely excluded. There are likely bilateral small pleural effusions, right greater than left. \n\nAbdominal XR: \n___: FINDINGS: Study is mildly compromised secondary to habitus. No definite dilated loops of small bowel are evident. There is stool throughout the descending colon. No abnormal calcifications are noted overlying the renal fossae. There is a curvilinear calcification in the left deep pelvis, presumably vascular in origin. Extensive degenerative disease is noted throughout the included thoracolumbar spine. IMPRESSION: No radiographic evidence for obstruction. \n\nCT abd and pelvis:\n___: CT OF THE ABDOMEN WITHOUT IV CONTRAST: Please note the lack of intravenous contrast, significantly limits detailed evaluation of the intra-abdominal organs and bowel. There are bilateral small pleural effusions, left greater than right with associated atelectasis. Marked cardiomegaly is additionally noted. An 8-mm low-attenuation focus within the left lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but likely represents a simple cyst (2:21). Similarly, a 7-mm low-attenuation focus in the right lobe of the liver is too small to characterize but also likely represents a simple cyst (2:26). The liver is otherwise unremarkable. Please note, moderate abdominal and pelvic ascites also limits detailed evaluation. The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and abdominal portions of the small bowel appear grossly unremarkable. There are bilateral simple renal cysts, the largest of which is located at the upper pole of the right kidney and measures 5.3 cm in diameter (2:20). The kidneys are otherwise unremarkable. Numerous colonic diverticula are present. T"

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension.

She pushed life alert and EMS came. They helped her back into bed. She later attempted to walk to the bathroom and fell again. However she did hit the back of her head and neck on a window as she fell. Denies LOC before or after fall. Denies chest pain, palpitations, shortness of breath, dizziness, lightheadedness. States she often falls because her knees give out. \n\nShe does feel weak overall.  She has stable 2 pillow orthopnea and DOE (can not walk more than a block). She does not take her lasix for her CHF because it makes her urinate too frequently. States she is on 1.5L of O2 at home for \"her heart.\" She has been eating less than usual lately because she does not have an appetite. She denies fevers, chills, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting. She denies dysuria or hematuria but does endorse urinary frequency. She denies any fever or chills but does have chronic productive cough. She was treated for a UTI last week with p.o. Cipro and finished antibiotic for several days ago. She has a history of recurrent UTIs (see below). \n\nHx of recurrent UTIs: Last UTI with multi-drug resistant organism. Pt was tx with Macrodantin. Recently saw Dr. B urology. It is unclear whether these represent symptomatic UTIs or is just asymptomatic bacteriuria.  Pt states that everytime she falls she finds out she has a UTI. She denies any dysuria, hematuria, subprapubic pain, smelling or cloudy urine during these episodes. Does state she has urinary freq and incontinence.\n \nPt video-urodynamic study in that showed Hypersensitive, low capacity bladder, Reflux grade to both kidneys, Detrusor over activity- terminal. Pt given Gentamycin 80 mg IV  given right hip and started Cipro BID x five days. Plan for cystoscopy with Dr. B.\n\nHx of frequent falls: Pt states she has been falling frequently for several years. Had been having about one fall/mo but states now that she uses a walker she has been falling much less. Evaluated by neuro for these frequent falls (1x/mo) and gait problems (felt shakey and unsteady on her feet). Gait disorder and falls thought to be from by loss of proprioception due to large fiber peripheral neuropathy. Had been concern for NPH given enlarged ventricles out of proportion to atrophy on CT but given lack of clinical symptoms at that time, further workup not pursued.\n\nIn the ED, initial vs were: 99.0 98 180/96 20 96% 2L  Labs were remarkable for UA with neg nitrites, few bac, 29 wbc. INR 2.3. Patient was given Acetaminophen 500mg.   \n \nOn the floor, pt states she continues to have a mild right temporal headache and shoulder pain where she fell.  \n \nReview of sytems:  \n(+) Per HPI, +HA, + cough, +DOE, +chronic knee pain  \n(-) Denies fever, chills, night sweats, recent weight loss or gain. Denies sinus tenderness, rhinorrhea or congestion. Denies shortness of breath. Denies chest pain or tightness, palpitations. Denies nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation or abdominal pain. No recent change in bowel or bladder habits. No dysuria.  Ten point review of systems is otherwise negative.71 year old female with PMH of HTN, b/l PE, Afib s/p pacemaker, asthma now presenting with SOB and general malaise.  Pt reports having been feeling progressively more lethargic over the past two months; states that her last time at her USOH was 2 months ago.  She reports having increased urinary frequency in the past month, and especially in the past week.  She had one episode of chills in her apartment but her temperature at that time was 99, per her report.  She has oxygen for nighttime use at home, but felt that she was still dyspneic at rest even when on 2L.\n\nShe called her NP yesterday and was diagnosed with a UTI and rx'd macrobid, of which she has taken two doses.  She called EMS this morning when she was lethargic and felt nauseous despite not having eaten anything.  On arrival to the ED, she was noted to be very pale.  Her initial vitals were 97.8 82 ___ 98%(2L).  Hemeoccult was negative.  Her crit was low at 29 and her INR was high at 4.1 while in the ED.  CXR showed increased fluid in the lungs, with some question of focal R opacities that could be infectious in nature.  She was given 40 mg IV lasix, had a catheter placed and was transferred to the floor for diuresis.  She reports having two pillow orthopnea at baseline and is not sure of her dry weight.

The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve appears structurally normal with trivial mitral regurgitation. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation is seen. Moderate [2+] tricuspid regurgitation is seen. There is moderate pulmonary artery systolic hypertension. There is no pericardial effusion. \nIMPRESSION: Normal biventricular cavity sizes with preserved global biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation. Pulmonary artery hypertension.

History is gathered from the patient's two daughters, as he is too obtunded to give a history.  Per his daughters, he had been experiencing increasing CP all week since being discharged from rehab.  Has had multiple episodes of chest pain that came on with both rest and exertion, as well as while sitting on the toilet trying to have BM. Associated with diaphoresis and radiation of pain to left arm. Episodes lasted less than an hour usually and were relieved with multiple doses of nitro.  He also was complaining of worsening shortness of breath, which became signficantly worse last night.  Has been sleeping sitting up in a chair, becomes dyspneic and has chest pain when lying flat.  Daughters also endorse PND and worsening lower extremity edema. \n﻿\nGiven all these symptoms, his daughters have called a few times this week, but thus far the patient had refused to go.  Today they mentioned his symptoms at a pre-op visit for CABG planning, and they were told to call their cardiologist, who recommended they bring him to the ER.  They brought him to hospital, where he was tachypneic and tachycardic, so he was started on BiPAP.  Nitro paste was applied, resulting in hypotension, so paste was removed.  Cardiac enzymes at that time were negative and ECG showed baseline LVH with \"strain\" pattern. Given that his providers were and he is scheduled to undergo CABG here next week, he was transferred to ED via med-evac flight.  While en route he started to not tolerate the BiPAP, was given ativan 2mg IV, and subsequently became obtunded. \nOn arrival to hospital, initial vitals were HR: 99, BP: 179/70, and \nhis GCS was 7, he was satting 90% on NRB.  He was switched back onto BiPAP given his belly breathing, poor breath sounds at bases with crackles. He was started low dose nitro gtt with drop in pressures again, so this was stopped.

The patient since that time has been undergoing Prednisone taper with reduction in Prednisone dose from 30mg to 20mg. the patient called the clinic with report of evolving pain and dryness of her mouth for which nystatin swish and swallow was empirically started. Yesterday, note was made that the patient initially improved with nystatin but symptoms have since worsened for which oral lidocaine was prescribed. The patient was seen at clinic today per her report, no note yet available for review, and was sent to the ED for concern for recent diarrheal episode, diuretic use and finding of tachycardia to 120 in office. Per discussion with patient she reports predominant symptom that is bothering her is sense of dry mouth. She reports this has been ongoing for last 2 days with sensation of mild burning over her tongue. She denies pain over palate or mucosa, no known ulcers that she has noted herself. The patient denies any sense of dry eyes or pain. She reports if anything she has been experiencing sense of watery eyes over the last couple of days. The patient reports she has been taking POs well over last couple of weeks. She had 1 day where she had episodes of loose stool but this was otherwise self-resolving. She has noted increasing edema over few weeks for which she took 1 dose of diuretic a few days ago (does not recall name that was prescribed by her PCP. The patient has been wearing TEDs stockings for this.\nED Course: 98.3, 145/69, 113, 18, 97% RA. In the ED the patient had labs revealing for UA with > 50 WBC, WBC 10.9, Cr of 1.0 and lactate of 1.5. The patient received 2L NS without improvement in tachycardia. The patient is now admitted to the medical service for evaluation and treatment per discretion of emergency department given concern discharging patient with persistent tachycardia.",

Briefly, she has not had a flare which consisted of left foot numbness which completely resolved after a 5 day course of IV solumedrol. She was on plegridy up until a few weeks ago when she discovered she was pregnant, and stopped this medication. Upon evaluation by Dr. was felt that she could be experiencing another flare despite her pregnancy, and an admission was recommended, however patient decided to leave AMA. \n﻿\nShe states that a few hours after finishing her first infusion, she started to develop a sensation of her left side feeling \"off\" which she has difficulty describing, but endorses is difficulty functioning with her left hand, for example she is missing keys while texting on her phone. She is also experiencing tingling in the hand. She also endorses that her coordination and balance are \"off\", and that she has to hold on to walls while ambulating. This is new for her. She also had a sensation that her left eye \"wants to be closed\", but she denies any vision loss, blurred vision, or double vision.\n﻿\nInitially she attributed these symptoms to a side effect of solumedrol, however this morning she continued to experience them, and concerned, she called the on-call neurology resident who advised her to come to the ED for evaluation.

She has a h/o RRMS diagnosed first with an episode of L-sided optic neuritis. However, retrospectively she had an episode of decreased visual acuity and difficulty walking and drove herself to the hospital only to fall out of the car semiconcious at the hospital doors. She has not had a flare years. In total she has had 4 clinical episodes during this time, averaging approximately every 18 months. She describes her episodes as beginning with decreased appetite and weight loss progressing to difficulty walking and blurried vision. During her episodes she becomes wheelchair bound, although between episodes she describes her walking as completely normal and feels that she even walks faster than most people. Her vision in her L eye recovered after her first two flares, but she is now only able to see shadows out of her L eye. She reports that flares always happen in the winter. Since her diagnosis Ms. has been taking Avonex full dose (30 mcg weekly). Her medication was changed to Tysabri and she stopped the Avonex. \n.\nThis particular flare began approximately weeks prior to admission when Ms. noticed that her walking was slowing. She also began noticing an intense burning pain extending from below her breasts symmetrically down her torso and both of her legs to the bottom of her feet. She was taking Aleve twice a day with improvement in the pain. This pain is a new symptom that she has not had with previous flares - at least not to this extent. She noticed that her knees felt week two days prior to admission and on the day prior to admission she was wheelchair bound. At the time of presentation she reports that she is able to walk a bit better with her walker. \n.\nOf note, Ms. reports that her best friend died of colon cancer 5 weeks prior to presentation. In addition, Ms. one episode of vertigo which lasted a full day one month prior to admission for which she was not evaluated. She also has noticed increased urinary urgency, whichshe believes is due to drinking more fluids and difficulty getting to the bathroom in the last few days. She has not had a bowel movement in 4 days, which is not normal for her. At baseline, she has electrical sensations in the base of her head and neck at baseline worse with neck flexion (Lhermitte's phenomenon). She describes generalized painful electrical sensations in her lower extremities bilaterally.

There is prominence of the ventricles and sulci, most likely due to age-related parenchymal atrophy. Hypodense areas are seen within the cerebellar hemispheres, most likely due to small vessel ischemic changes. Visualized portions of the paranasal sinuses show some mild mucosal thickening of the frontal and ethmoid sinuses. Mastoid air cells are clear. \n\nCT ABDOMEN AND PELVIS W/O CONTRAST ___\nPatchy consolidation is seen within the left lower lobe of the lung consistent with pneumonia. A small pleural effusion is also seen on the left. In addition, there is dependent atelectasis in the right lung. The heart size is normal. No pericardial effusion is noted. \n  \nThe liver, gallbladder, spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, stomach, and intra- abdominal loops of bowel are within normal limits. There are tiny non- obstructing renal stones seen within the kidneys bilaterally. In addition, multiple well-circumscribed hypodense areas are seen within the kidneys bilaterally, most consistent with cysts, unchanged. There is diffuse calcification of the abdominal aorta and the splenic, celiac, common hepatic, and iliac arteries. There is no retroperitoneal or mesenteric lymphadenopathy. No free air or free fluid is seen. High-density material is seen within the dependent portion of the second segment of the duodenum, which may be due to recent ingestion of high density material (ie medication or contrast).\n\nSputum with MRSA bronch: sensitive to Clinda, Tetracycline, Bactrim, Vancomycin, (Resistant to Erythro, Oxacillin, Penicillin, Cefazolin)."

Pt remembers a feeling of something \"sitting on my chest\" before he lost consciousness.\n﻿\nPt estimates that he was unconscious for approximately 5 minutes. His wife said he twitched once, but otherwise had no jerking movements.  Pt thought he was incontinent of a small amount of urine after the event.  He was a little slow to return to normal, but within 20 minutes he was speaking normally with EMT's.  He did not have any tongue biting during the episode.  \n﻿\nPt states that he had been taking his enoxaparin until hisprescription ran out (reports 40mg BID at home).  He took it for 10 days after his surgery, and his been off it for approximately weeks.  \n﻿\nPatient denies headache, vision changes, cough, runny nose, fever, aches/pains, abdominal pain, bowel habit changes, or dysuria.  He further denies preceding fevers, palpitations, dizziness/lightheadedness.  \n﻿",

Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). The right ventricular cavity is mildly dilated with no more than borderline-mild global hypokinesis (suboptimal image quality). The ascending aorta is mildly dilated. The aortic valve leaflets (3) are mildly thickened but aortic stenosis is not present. No aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure could not be determined. There is a trivial/physiologic pericardial effusion. There is an anterior space which most likely represents a prominent fat pad. The patient is hemodynamically stable.\n﻿\n﻿"

Labs revealed D-dimer elevation 7.2, troponin-I elevation to 0.815, NT proBNP elevated at 2374. EKG showed normal sinus rhythm with anterior lateral TWI (V2-V6). CT chest showed moderate bilateral pulmonary emboli with the largest being in the right lower lobe, mild RV dilation, with main pulmonary artery dilated 3.6 cm.  Echocardiogram was obtained prior to transfer which was significant for positive sign, moderately dilated right ventricle, with moderately reduced RV function. LV function was normal.\n﻿\nShe was subsequently transferred where hospital course was notable for multiple episodes of SVT with rates into the 160s. Repeat troponin-T was reassuring at 0.02. ICU team was consulted for consideration thrombolytics which were felt to be unnecessary. Per family request, she was subsequently transferred for further evaluation.\n﻿\nUpon arrival to the ICU, she reports feeling overall well but continues to be mildly dyspneic.

According to the transfer summary, he initially presented with abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, and an inability to tolerate oral intake or medications. His blood glucose levels were in the 600s and his blood pressure was 200/80s. He was administered IV fluids, and his blood glucose levels were stabilized. There was no evidence of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) at that time. He was admitted for further evaluation and experienced some coffee-ground emesis, for which an endoscopy was performed, revealing gastritis.\n﻿\nOn the 2nd hospital day, the patient noted that since just prior to his previous situation, his speech has been different. He says that he is unable to speak at a normal rate and that his speech is no longer \"very good.\" He reports having difficulty both with finding words and with saying them. Although he occasionally wears dentures, he is usually able to speak well without them, but now he cannot. He cannot provide specific examples of his speech difficulty. According to the transfer note, he confirmed the change in his speech. He states that he has never had difficulty speaking prior to this episode. He also notes that around the time his speech difficulty began, his left hand has felt more numb and clumsy than usual. He normally walks using a cane in his left hand but has had trouble holding the cane.",

Abrupt cut off of the distal M1 segment of the right internal carotid artery with high-grade focal narrowing at the origin of the right M2 superior division and nonvisualization of the M2 inferior division. \n3. Extensive calcified and soft atherosclerotic plaque at the carotid bifurcations extending into the proximal portion of the internal and external carotid arteries results in approximately 50% narrowing of the internal carotid artery origins by NASCET criteria. \n4. There is a 6 x 8 mm spiculated right upper lobe pulmonary nodule in addition to a nodular area of parenchymal consolidation with adjacent distortion along the periphery of the left upper lobe measuring 1.6 x 2.1 cm.  There also multiple mildly prominent mediastinal lymph nodes.  Comparison with prior chest CTs, if available available is recommended.  Alternatively, dedicated chest CT or PET-CT can be considered for further evaluation, as malignancy cannot be excluded. \n﻿\nMRI brain\nIMPRESSION: \n  \n  \n1. Late acute infarcts in the right MCA distribution predominantly involving the right basal ganglia and posterior limb of the right internal capsule with multiple additional punctate foci in the right external capsule, insula, parietal and temporal lobes. \n2. Punctate chronic microhemorrhage in the left thalamus. \n3. Additional white matter changes are suggestive of chronic small vessel \nischemic disease. \n﻿\n  \nCT chest\nIMPRESSION:  \n  \n1.

Partially seen distal pancreatic atrophy disproportionate to the size of the head on a background of chronic pancreatitis as well a CBD stent with expected pneumobilia.  These findings could be due to an underlying pancreatic malignancy such as adenocarcinoma, particularly in the setting \nof a stent.

An addendum can be issued if requested with a comparison of the findings if prior imaging becomes available. \n﻿\nTTE:\nThe left atrial volume index is mildly increased. No atrial septal defect or patent foramen ovale is seen by 2D, color Doppler or saline contrast with maneuvers. Left ventricular wall thickness, cavity size and regional/global systolic function are normal (LVEF >55%). Tissue Doppler imaging suggests a normal left ventricular filling pressure (PCWP<12mmHg). Right ventricular chamber size and free wall motion are normal. A bioprosthetic aortic valve prosthesis is present. The aortic valve prosthesis appears well seated, with normal leaflet/disc motion and transvalvular gradients. Mild (1+) aortic regurgitation is seen. The mitral valve leaflets are mildly thickened. There is no mitral valve prolapse. Trivial mitral regurgitation is seen. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is normal. There is no pericardial effusion."

There is no evidence of hemorrhagic transformation at the moment of this study. In the supratentorial compartment, there is evidence of restricted diffusion involving the left temporal lobe as well as the left occipital region, these areas are also demonstrated on the FLAIR with low signal in the corresponding ADC map. Mild effacement of the sulci is demonstrated; however, there is no evidence of uncal herniation or significant midline shifting. On T2 and FLAIR, there are multiple scattered hyperintensity areas in both centrum semiovale and subcortical white matter consistent with chronic angiopathic ischemic changes. The orbits, the paranasal sinuses and the mastoid air cells appear grossly normal."

The therapy was held due to multiple symptoms, including nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, extreme fatigue, and hallucinations. \n.\nThe patient reports onset of most of these symptoms after his second treatment, including nausea and vomiting 4 days ago ('orange colored, no bile or blood, vomiting 2x/day) and hallucinations of seeing people who have passed away (including his mother). He has no hallucinations currently. Also, after administration of the AMG 386 he experienced significant swelling around his eyes. He has been much more fatigued, and noticed some increased cold intolerance since starting the medication as well, requiring extra blankets at home.  Has had 10 lb weight loss. Denies any tremors, hair loss, constipation or diarrhea. Has had increased dysphagia with swallowing pills, stating that he feels like they get stuck in his upper throat. \n﻿\nHe also complains of L-sided abdominal pain that radiates to his L groin and L leg. Been present for months, but has worsened recently. Has not noticed any masses in his groin, but pain seems to worsen with bearing weight. \n.\nOn the floor, patient denies any nausea after receiving some anti-emetics in clinic, pain or confusion.",
